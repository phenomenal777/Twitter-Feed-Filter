It is the second-largest heavy commercial vehicle manufacturer in South Korea and was acquired by Tata Motors in 2004.

Tata Motors has jointly worked with Tata Daewoo to develop trucks such as Novus and World Truck and buses including GloBus and StarBus.

The editors cited "electronics, drive system, power equipment, noises and leaks" as problematic aspects.[36] The Jaguar Land Rover subsidiary was struggling by 2019 and Tata Motors wrote down its investment in JLR by $3.9 billion. Much of the financial problem was due to a 50% drop in sales in China during 2019, although the situation was improving. Still, Tata was open to considering a partnership with another company according to a statement in mid-October, as long as the partnership agreement would allow Tata to maintain control of the business.

In 2008 Tata Motors' UK subsidiary, Tata Motors European Technical Centre, bought a 50.3% holding in electric vehicle technology firm Miljbil Grenland/Innovasjon of Norway for US$1.93 million, and planned to launch the electric Indica hatchback in Europe the following year.[50][51][52] In September 2010, Tata Motors presented four CNGElectric Hybrid low-floored Starbuses to the Delhi Transport Corporation, to be used during the 2010 Commonwealth Games. These were the first environmentally friendly buses to be used for public transportation in India. In December 2019, Tata Motors unveiled the Nexon EV, an SUV with a 30.2KWh lithium-ion battery and a consistent range of 312 km on a single charge. It is also equipped with fast charging technology, which can charge the vehicle from 0% - 80% in 60 minutes.[53] With 525 units of Nexon EV sold in India last month, Tata Nexon EV[54] was the best-selling electric car in the month of April 2021 in India. Tata Passenger Electric Mobility is a subsidiary which produces electric cars under the brand name Tata Motors.[55] List of Tata electric vehicles: Tata Nexon EV Tata Tigor EV Tata Altroz EV Tata Tiago EV Tata Ace EV Electric Vehicle Concepts[edit] Tata Curvv Tata Avinya Tata evision Discontinued Models[edit] Tata Telcoline (19882010) Tata Sierra (19912003) Tata Estate (19922000) Tata Sumo (19942019) Tata Indica (19982015) Tata Spacio (2000-2011) Tata Indigo (20022015) Tata Indigo Marina (20062009) Tata Xenon (20072018) Tata Sumo Grande (20082016) Tata Vista (20082015) Tata Nano (20082018) Tata Manza (20092016) Tata Venture (20102017) Tata Aria (20102017) Tata Zest (20142020) Tata Bolt (20142019) Tata Hexa (20172020) Notable vehicles[edit] Tata Nano[edit] Main article: Tata Nano Tata Nano is often cited as the world's most affordable car The Nano was launched in 2009 as a city car intended to appeal as an affordable alternative to the section of the Indian populace that is primarily the owner of motorcycles and has not bought their first car. Initially priced at 100,000 (US$1,500), the vehicle attracted a lot of attention for its relatively low price. However, the Nano was very poorly rated for safety[56][57] and in 2018, Cyrus Mistry, chairman of the Tata Group, called the Tata Nano a failed project, with production ending in May 2018.[58] Tata Ace[edit] Main article: Tata Ace Tata Super Ace Tata Ace, India's first indigenously developed sub-one-ton minitruck, was launched in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed the dynamics of the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport. By October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by Autoline Industries.[59] By 2005, Autoline was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors. Ace is still a top seller for TML with 500,000 units sold by June 2010.[60] In 2011, Tata Motors invested Rs 1000 crore in Dharwad Plant, Karnataka, with the capacity of 90,000 units annually and launched two models of 0.5-T capacity as Tata Ace Zip, Magic Iris.[61] Ace has also been exported to several Asian, European, South American, and African countries and all-electric models are sold through Polaris Industries' Global Electric Motorcars division. In Sri Lanka, it is sold through Diesel & Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC under the name of DIMO Batta. Tata Prima[edit] Main article: Tata Prima A Tata Prima 4928.S in Assam, India Tata Prima is a range of heavy trucks first introduced in 2008 as the company's 'global' truck. Tata Prima was the winner of the 'Commercial Vehicle of the Year' at the Apollo Commercial Vehicles Awards, 2010 and 2012. Tata 407[edit] Main article: Tata 407 A Tata 407 being used as water truck The Tata 407 is a light commercial vehicle (LCV) that has sold over 500,000 units since its launch in 1986.[62] In India, this vehicle dominates market share of the LCV category, accounting for close to 75% of LCV sales. The 407 model range includes trucks, tippers, pick-ups and vehicles for agri/food products, construction, light mining and services.[63] Tata Harrier[edit] Main article: Tata Harrier Tata Harrier Tata Harrier is a 5-seater SUV that rivals the MG Hector and Jeep Compass. This car uses the engine from Fiat which is a 2.0 L-4 cylinder turbocharged diesel motor and transmission from Hyundai which is a 6-speed, available in both manual and automatic. Tata Harrier is derived from the H5X Concept displayed at the 2018 Auto Expo. It was launched on 23 January 2019.[64] The car is a C-segment crossover SUV based on the OmegaArc platform, an essentially re-engineered version of the Jaguar Land Rover D8 platform.[65] A petrol variant of the Harrier is confirmed to launch in 2022-23.[66] Tata Harrier is also available in Nepal with the name H5. Tata Nexon[edit] Main article: Tata Nexon Tata Nexon The Tata Nexon is a subcompact crossover SUV produced by Tata Motors since 2017. It is the first crossover SUV from Tata Motors, and occupies the sub-4 metre crossover SUV segment in India.[67] The electric version of the Nexon was revealed on 19 December 2019. The Nexon EV uses components from Tata Motors' electric vehicle technology brand Ziptron. The electric motor produces 94.7 kW (127 hp; 129 PS) and 245 Nm (181 lbfft) of torque and 0 - 100 under 9.9 seconds. It has a 30.2 kWh battery with an ARAI rated range of up to 312 km.[68] The battery can be fully charged in under 8 hours using a complimentary AC charger. It can also be charged using a 15-ampere power cable that can be used at any place with the necessary power socket. DC 25 kW fast charging can be used to charge the battery from 0 to 80% in 1 hour.[69] See also[edit] List of companies of India List of largest companies by revenue List of corporations by market capitalisation Make in India Forbes Global 2000 Fortune India 500 Automotive industry in India Tata Revotron engine References[edit] ^ "Contact Us - Tata Motors Limited". www.tatamotors.com. 14 October 2015.

It is the second-largest heavy commercial vehicle manufacturer in South Korea and was acquired by Tata Motors in 2004. The principal reasons behind the acquisition were to reduce Tata's dependence on the Indian commercial vehicle market (which was responsible for around 94% of its sales in the MHCV segment and around 84% in the light commercial vehicle segment) and expand its product portfolio by leveraging on Daewoo's strengths in the heavy-tonnage sector. Tata Motors has jointly worked with Tata Daewoo to develop trucks such as Novus and World Truck and buses including GloBus and StarBus.

The editors cited "electronics, drive system, power equipment, noises and leaks" as problematic aspects.[36] The Jaguar Land Rover subsidiary was struggling by 2019 and Tata Motors wrote down its investment in JLR by $3.9 billion. Much of the financial problem was due to a 50% drop in sales in China during 2019, although the situation was improving. Still, Tata was open to considering a partnership with another company according to a statement in mid-October, as long as the partnership agreement would allow Tata to maintain control of the business.

In 2008 Tata Motors' UK subsidiary, Tata Motors European Technical Centre, bought a 50.3% holding in electric vehicle technology firm Miljbil Grenland/Innovasjon of Norway for US$1.93 million, and planned to launch the electric Indica hatchback in Europe the following year.[50][51][52] In September 2010, Tata Motors presented four CNGElectric Hybrid low-floored Starbuses to the Delhi Transport Corporation, to be used during the 2010 Commonwealth Games. These were the first environmentally friendly buses to be used for public transportation in India. In December 2019, Tata Motors unveiled the Nexon EV, an SUV with a 30.2KWh lithium-ion battery and a consistent range of 312 km on a single charge. It is also equipped with fast charging technology, which can charge the vehicle from 0% - 80% in 60 minutes.[53] With 525 units of Nexon EV sold in India last month, Tata Nexon EV[54] was the best-selling electric car in the month of April 2021 in India. Tata Passenger Electric Mobility is a subsidiary which produces electric cars under the brand name Tata Motors.[55] List of Tata electric vehicles: Tata Nexon EV Tata Tigor EV Tata Altroz EV Tata Tiago EV Tata Ace EV Electric Vehicle Concepts[edit] Tata Curvv Tata Avinya Tata evision Discontinued Models[edit] Tata Telcoline (19882010) Tata Sierra (19912003) Tata Estate (19922000) Tata Sumo (19942019) Tata Indica (19982015) Tata Spacio (2000-2011) Tata Indigo (20022015) Tata Indigo Marina (20062009) Tata Xenon (20072018) Tata Sumo Grande (20082016) Tata Vista (20082015) Tata Nano (20082018) Tata Manza (20092016) Tata Venture (20102017) Tata Aria (20102017) Tata Zest (20142020) Tata Bolt (20142019) Tata Hexa (20172020) Notable vehicles[edit] Tata Nano[edit] Main article: Tata Nano Tata Nano is often cited as the world's most affordable car The Nano was launched in 2009 as a city car intended to appeal as an affordable alternative to the section of the Indian populace that is primarily the owner of motorcycles and has not bought their first car. Initially priced at 100,000 (US$1,500), the vehicle attracted a lot of attention for its relatively low price. However, the Nano was very poorly rated for safety[56][57] and in 2018, Cyrus Mistry, chairman of the Tata Group, called the Tata Nano a failed project, with production ending in May 2018.[58] Tata Ace[edit] Main article: Tata Ace Tata Super Ace Tata Ace, India's first indigenously developed sub-one-ton minitruck, was launched in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed the dynamics of the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport. By October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by Autoline Industries.[59] By 2005, Autoline was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors. Ace is still a top seller for TML with 500,000 units sold by June 2010.[60] In 2011, Tata Motors invested Rs 1000 crore in Dharwad Plant, Karnataka, with the capacity of 90,000 units annually and launched two models of 0.5-T capacity as Tata Ace Zip, Magic Iris.[61] Ace has also been exported to several Asian, European, South American, and African countries and all-electric models are sold through Polaris Industries' Global Electric Motorcars division. In Sri Lanka, it is sold through Diesel & Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC under the name of DIMO Batta. Tata Prima[edit] Main article: Tata Prima A Tata Prima 4928.S in Assam, India Tata Prima is a range of heavy trucks first introduced in 2008 as the company's 'global' truck. Tata Prima was the winner of the 'Commercial Vehicle of the Year' at the Apollo Commercial Vehicles Awards, 2010 and 2012. Tata 407[edit] Main article: Tata 407 A Tata 407 being used as water truck The Tata 407 is a light commercial vehicle (LCV) that has sold over 500,000 units since its launch in 1986.[62] In India, this vehicle dominates market share of the LCV category, accounting for close to 75% of LCV sales. The 407 model range includes trucks, tippers, pick-ups and vehicles for agri/food products, construction, light mining and services.[63] Tata Harrier[edit] Main article: Tata Harrier Tata Harrier Tata Harrier is a 5-seater SUV that rivals the MG Hector and Jeep Compass. This car uses the engine from Fiat which is a 2.0 L-4 cylinder turbocharged diesel motor and transmission from Hyundai which is a 6-speed, available in both manual and automatic. Tata Harrier is derived from the H5X Concept displayed at the 2018 Auto Expo. It was launched on 23 January 2019.[64] The car is a C-segment crossover SUV based on the OmegaArc platform, an essentially re-engineered version of the Jaguar Land Rover D8 platform.[65] A petrol variant of the Harrier is confirmed to launch in 2022-23.[66] Tata Harrier is also available in Nepal with the name H5. Tata Nexon[edit] Main article: Tata Nexon Tata Nexon The Tata Nexon is a subcompact crossover SUV produced by Tata Motors since 2017. It is the first crossover SUV from Tata Motors, and occupies the sub-4 metre crossover SUV segment in India.[67] The electric version of the Nexon was revealed on 19 December 2019. The Nexon EV uses components from Tata Motors' electric vehicle technology brand Ziptron. The electric motor produces 94.7 kW (127 hp; 129 PS) and 245 Nm (181 lbfft) of torque and 0 - 100 under 9.9 seconds. It has a 30.2 kWh battery with an ARAI rated range of up to 312 km.[68] The battery can be fully charged in under 8 hours using a complimentary AC charger. It can also be charged using a 15-ampere power cable that can be used at any place with the necessary power socket. DC 25 kW fast charging can be used to charge the battery from 0 to 80% in 1 hour.[69] See also[edit] List of companies of India List of largest companies by revenue List of corporations by market capitalisation Make in India Forbes Global 2000 Fortune India 500 Automotive industry in India Tata Revotron engine References[edit] ^ "Contact Us - Tata Motors Limited". www.tatamotors.com. 14 October 2015.
